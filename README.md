    *  Write down long term goals and plans, and record achievements
    *  Maintain a journal of events, thoughts and moods for reflection.
    *  Create habits and monitor how well you adhere to them
    *  Store personal information like weight, diet and exercise project.
  
  * Operations
    *  Latest News (06:00 -> newsfetch -> filter and process -> write text to block)
    *  Relevant jobs (06:00 -> selenium indeed -> "data analyst", "bi developer")
    *  Make new friends (Idc maybe a friend making app or something) 
  
  * Entertainment and Relationship Management
    *  How often should I go on a holiday? And where should I go? With whom?

    * How *should* I spend my time after work and on the weekends? 
    * If I were to be unemployed what should I do? When should I wake up? What should I do with my day.
    * How would life look like if I was just to live to optimise for my moods?

The wider goal is for this application to understand and promote rational behaviour.
